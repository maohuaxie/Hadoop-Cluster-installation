    "- The review dataset holds the text of the customer reviews and their star rating. \n",
    "- Can we build a model that could predict the star rating based on the reviewer text?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Idea\n",
    "- Certain words might be more likely used in a negative review (1 Star) than in a positive review(5 Stars). And the other way around.\n",
    "- That means: the occurrence of a word entails a certain likelihood for this review to be bad, and a certain likelihood to be good.\n",
    "- If we assume that all the words are probabilistically independent we could actually make predictions based on the joint probability of all the words in the review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preparation\n",
    "- In order to obtain the probability of a word to appear in a given star rated review, $P(word \\;|\\; rating=s)$,  we need to create a table of words and the star rating of the review where they appeared. (We only count a word once per review...even if it occurs multiple times.)\n",
    "- We can use MapReduce to create the desired table. Then continue in Hive to compute those probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predicting stars\n",
    "- Let's assume we have a review that contains a certain number of words $W = \\{w_1, w_2, ..., w_n\\}$\n",
    "- The likelihood that this review would receive a rating $s$ would be \n",
    "\n",

    "P(rating=s\\;|\\;W) = \\Pi_{w \\in W} P(w\\;|\\;rating=s)\n",
